# Events_web
This is a project done in 2024.


1) All of the documentation is available in pdf files, including a 7 minute video with analysis of the features and implementation methods (IA_CS_crit_D.mp4).

2) The free hosting (000webhost.com) for this website expired so as of now the project is not live.

3) Some of the solution's implementation is available in the IA_CS_crit_C with refferences to what it does and why the choice was made.

4) Enjoy! ;)
