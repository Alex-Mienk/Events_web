# Events_web
This is a project done in 2024.


1) All of the documentation is available in the cover_page file, including a 7 minute video with analysis of the features and implementation methods.
2) The free hosting (000webhost.com) for this website expired so as of now the project is not live.
3) Source files cannot be found due to my shortsightedness of not dedicating enough time to saving them properly.
4) Some of the code is available in the IA_CS_crit_C with refferences to what it does and why the choice was made.
5) Please take a look at the video of the implementation.
